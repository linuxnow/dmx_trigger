Start daemons as systemd units.

1. Create units
---------------
# sysemd units for olad and dmx_trigger
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp *.service ~/.config/systemd/user

# config in a separate config 
mkdir ~/.config/dmx_trigger/
cp dmx_trigger_concert.conf ~/.config/dmx_trigger/

We can have several dmx_triggers units listening in different universes.
This way we can have a universe for concert videos and another for dance.

2. Install
# if we install olad with an rpm/deb we can remove the --user part
systemctl --user enable --now olad
systemctl --user start  olad
systemctl --user enable --now dmx_trigger_concert
systemctl --user start dmx_trigger_concert

3. Manage units
systemctl --user start dmx_trigger_concert

4. Start
Unit files are configured to be autoamtically started:
-olad: when we reach network and multi_user target
-dmx_trigger_concert when we reach olad and graphic.session

As dmx_triggers starts videos, it needs not only a grapical target but a session for the user.

2. Patching
olad provides devices (ArtNet, E1.31, OSC) and ports for each device.
We have to bind an ArtNet port ot our universe.

$ ola_dev_info
Device 2: ArtNet [192.168.1.11]
  port 0, IN, priority 100, RDM supported
  port 1, IN, priority 100, RDM supported
  port 2, IN, priority 100, RDM supported
  port 3, IN, priority 100, RDM supported
  port 0, OUT, RDM supported
  port 1, OUT, RDM supported
  port 2, OUT, RDM supported
  port 3, OUT, RDM supported

# We choose ArtNEt (Device -2) and an inp√πt device (-i)
# We patch universe 5 to port 0
$ ola_patch -d 2 -p 0 -i -u 5
# We patch universe 6 to port 1
$ ola_patch -d 2 -p 1 -i -u 5
